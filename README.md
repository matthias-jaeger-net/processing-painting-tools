## Toolset of methods to painterly draw within a processing sketch
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. I base my toolset on this creative collection of methods and try to extend them to fit the needs of painters, illustrators and graphic designers. 

## A sidenote to myself (maybe useful to you)
This is one one of countless attemps to organize my creative coding and collect what I already know. While attempting creative coding projects you can easily get distracted and work in crazy directions, producing non-reusable programs full of hard coded elements. Here I will try to be strict to myself and write simple functions doing one thing only. Can I even do that? We will find out, because I havent written any code yet. Starting out with the readme first seems a good thing.

## Structure of a processing sketch  
```java
void settigs() {}
```

```java
void setup() {}
```

```java
void draw() {}
```
